Beetle2 gubbins

Dimensions

Width - approx 260mm

Height - very short (<100mm)

---

Six panels running front-back made of 10mm hdpe. The outermost ones
will work as wheel guards, the others anchor the motors and other gubbins.

Four wheel drive, front wheels driven directly, rear wheels via belt.

Use Polyurethane drive belts (green) which can be cut to length and
welded together with a hot air gun.

Wheel diameter: ideally big enough that we can get a lot of drive
	Maybe ~ 70mm and that is the highest part of the robot
	
Six panels are all the same outline shape but with some different holes drilled.

2x 22mm drive motors
2x 25mm weapon motors (25mm hi torque)

Lifter weapon

Direct drive from 2x hi torque double gear 25mm motors.
Use higher ratio / slower motors 

194rpm motors, give 27kgcm of stall torque at nominal 12volts. 
Opponent COM will be about 200mm from the pivot.
so 1.5kg * 20cm = 30kgcm 
BUT we have 2 motors and run them on 4S (16volt) so expect enough.

No-load speed 194rpm = 3 revs/sec which is plenty!
Could use slower motors (= higher ratio) but may cause gearboxes to fail

Structural
----------

How do we attach the panels?
Can use a thin base plate (3mm or less)
This needs to be shaped so that it won't foul the drive.

Threaded rods - structural.
M8 Threaded rod + nuts, washers. Cut to length and add nuts as necessary.
Available in wickes.
